# First project for Udacity course 
Personal Blog Site

First full website I have built since starting my web dev journey.

This project was very challenging but I learned alot of things along the way such as:

- Creating proper class/id names is important. Be as specific as possible to alleviate confusion.
- Need to improve on adding comments to code.
- landmarking and aria-labels 
- Designing and coding the website are challenging. I coded 2 rough drafts before deciding on the third and final design. 
- I realized design was my weakpoint and solved the issue by finding inspiration from other sites.

Even though I coded 2 other websites before deciding on the thrid this gave me alot of practice with getting started on a awebsite from scratch.

Overall, the experience was great because I was able to go from 0 to a complete full website, which is something that I had not done until now. My future goals will be to write cleaner code, learn frameworks and incorporate javascript.
